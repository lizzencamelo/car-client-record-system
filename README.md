# Welcome to the Chevrolet Client Record System

A *simple log system* that records the purchase details of a Chevrolet car tailored to the style and comfort of our clients. It also provides the administration a glimpse at all the records of their clientele.


Built using an interactive menu driven C++ program, our project is founded on the essential principles of OOP: classes, objects, inheritance, data abstraction and encapsulation, polymorphism.

- The **client panel** will direct the client to customizing their car with accessories and amenities. They will be prompted to enter their personal details- name, contact number, email-and vehicle number details. The final display includes a glance at the custom-made car features along with client information and payment details.
